Chris Warrick’s AUR PKGBUILDs
=============================

This repo stores [all my PKGBUILDs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=Kwpolska) in the AUR.  It’s useless on GitHub.com (the web app) though.  **To access packages:** `git clone --recursive`; or (in an existing clone) `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

It also stores `aur.zsh`, an automation script, and a requirements.txt file, used to automate management via requires.io.
